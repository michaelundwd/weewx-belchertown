Testing Belchertown Reports
===========================

There are two reasons for using a testing arangement

1	To test new versions of the Belchertown skin after updates have been made before release to Lordship Weather
2	Whilst developing a version of the Lordship Weather website.  Can be used with care for any modifications.


Using and Switching Belchertown test skin On & Off
==================================================

1	Check skin_blank exists in Belchertown/test folder
2	Check skin_test.conf exists in the Belchertown/test folder
3	Edits are made to skin.conf in BelchertownTest folder when it is set to skin_test.conf

ON	To turn the test report generation ON:
	1	copy skin_test.conf to skin.conf for editing and testing
OFF	To turn the test report generation OFF: 
	1	copy skin.conf to skin_test.conf, preserving the changes that have been made during testing
	2	copy skin_blank.conf to skin.conf, to ensure the blank is  used


IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

Watch for the generate tags.  They have been commented out for testing but need to be replaced for live operation.
Probably the best way of moving test to live is to do a compare on the test and live .conf files
and then move the significant differences from test to live

Also necessary to force the complete regeneration of all files because of the generate tags (daily, weekly, monthly etc)




Setup
=====

Weewx - weewx.conf Changes
==========================

A Belchertown test setup, containing .conf files etc is set up in /etc/weewx/skins/Belchertown/test
The weewx config file /etc/weex/weewx.conf is modified to contain a new stanza to produce reports in /var/weewx/reports/test

    [[BelchertownTest]]
        skin = BelchertownTest
        HTML_ROOT = /var/weewx/reports/test
        belchertown_root_url = /var/weewx/reports/test
        [[[Units]]]
            [[[[Groups]]]]
                group_altitude = meter
                group_speed2 = mile_per_hour2
                group_pressure = mbar
                group_rain = mm
                group_rainrate = mm_per_hour
                group_temperature = degree_C
                group_degree_day = degree_C_day
                group_speed = mile_per_hour
            [[[[TimeFormats]]]]
                current = %x %H:%M hrs
        [[[Extras]]]
            highcharts_homepage_graphgroup = homepage
            site_title = Lordship Weather
            footer_copyright_text = Lordship Weather
            forecast_enabled = 1

BelchertownTest Changes
=======================

The contents of /etc/weewx/skins/Belechertown are copied to etc/weewx/skins/BelchertownTest
A backup of skin.conf in /etc/weewx/BelchertownTest called skin_test.conf
A new skin.conf (skin_blank.conf) is produced in /etc/weewx/skins/BelchertownTest with no contents
This is then switched with skin_test.conf in the same folder to switch
